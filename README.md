# Java---Retirement-Array
This program takes the current ages of 10 employees and stores them in an array.   It then takes the desired retirement age of the 10 employees and stores them in the array.   That is all done with the getArray method using for loops.  Then the time remaining for the respective employees to work until retirement is displayed in sequence.
